# rfancontroller
RFanController is an ESP32/Arduino-compatible project for controlling 433.92 MHz RF ceiling fans by transmitting pre-captured raw RF signals. Unlike RCSwitch, it mimics the original signal for full compatibility. It supports WiFi &amp; MQTT, and can be adapted for other RF devices.
